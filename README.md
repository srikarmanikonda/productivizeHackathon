# Productivize
Productivize is an app enabling users during tough times such as the COVID-19 pandemic to be able to use their time effectively and productively. 

The App's main features include a card enabling users to select pre-written activities or choose their own, support for watching videos, a journal to record how they are spending their time on chosen activites, a timer, and achievements for accomplishment on time-based goals
